**Report & Vide & Source code**

Marks for your project work will be awarded (i) for the capabilities (i.e. functional requirements) your system achieves, and (ii) for evidence of the database design process you followed. Total marks for these two components will be allocated on an 85%/15% basis.

# Design Report

## General Requirement
- [ ] You may not use any proprietary development frameworks. 
- [ ] You will need to populate your database with illustrative data.
- [ ] Your design work should be focused on the database design and follow the structured methods taught in class. 
- [ ] You should translate the requirements as you interpret them into what data should be stored, the transactions those data support, how the data will be modified, and who will have access to it. 
- [ ] You must create an entity relationship diagram to fully represent the data of interest and their relationships and attributes. 
- [ ] You should translate that diagram systematically into a database schema defining the tables and relationships for your database. 
- [ ] You should show that the database is in third normal form.

## Specific Requirement:
(a single pdf file only)
- [ ] 1. URL for your Youtube video.
- [ ] 2. Your entity relationship diagram, giving any assumptions that it makes about the
processes that use the data.
- [ ] 3. A listing of your database schema (list of table names and attributes) with an explanation of how it translates the ER diagram.
- [ ] 4. An analysis showing that the database schema is in third normal form.
- [ ] 5. A listing and explanation of your database queries.

# Video

- [ ] The video demonstration should be about 5 to 8 minutes long with voice-over narration. 
- [ ] The video must show explicitly how each capability listed in the design brief below is achieved in your system. 
- [ ] It must go through each capability in the order in which it is listed in the Design Brief. 
- [ ] The narration must refer to the capability and preferably the video should flash back to the visual list. 
- [ ] With a spoken narration the video must show each capability you have achieved either through interaction with the user interface of your system or through execution of the relevant queries on the database through phpmyadmin. [ ] Examples of videos from previous years are on the Moodle page. 
- [ ] Videos should be uploaded to Youtube and made unlisted.

# Code
- [ ] You should submit an archive containing your source code (the PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, etc. files needed by your site). 
- [ ] Please only submit your source code, no binary data files or database dumps. 
- [ ] Please put your group number in the zip file name.
